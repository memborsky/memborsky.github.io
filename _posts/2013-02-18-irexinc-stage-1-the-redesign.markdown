For the first part of this project, I presented an entire site redesign. An example of what once was to what current is:

<p class="left"><em>Previous</em> <br /> <a href="http://i.imgur.com/gal6hnh.png" target="_blank" class="clean"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/gal6hnh.png" alt="Past IREX Website" width="370px" height="200px" /></a></p>
<p class="right"><em>Current</em> <br /> <a href="http://i.imgur.com/sxLN3ez.png" target="_blank" class="clean"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/sxLN3ez.png" alt="Current IREX Website" width="370px" height="200px" /></a></p>

<p class="clear"></p>

With the style change came a much needed simplistic approach to the site structure as well:

- Home
- Members
- Calendar
- By-Laws
- Documents

This first stage was a simple one. It brought about changes to simplify the content and streamlined for the next stage, MVC Time.
